## ðŸŒŸ About This Project

This Practical Data Engineering project addresses common data engineering challenges while exploring innovative technologies. It should serve as a learning project but incorporate comprehensive real-world use cases. It's a guide to building a data application that collects real-estate data, enriches it with various metrics, and offers insights through machine learning and data visualization. This application helps you find your dream properties in your area and showcases how to handle a full-fledged data engineering pipeline using modern tools and frameworks.

### Why this project?
- **Real-World Application**: Tackling a genuine problem with real estate data to find the best properties.
- **Comprehensive Tech Stack**: Utilizes a wide range of technologies from web scraping, S3 storage, data processing, machine learning, to data visualization and orchestration.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Offers a hands-on approach to understanding how different technologies integrate and complement each other in a real-world scenario.

### Key Features & Learnings:
- Scraping real estate listings with [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanisms for efficient data updates
- Utilizing [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) as an S3-Gateway for cloud-agnostic storage
- Implementing UPSERTs and ACID transactions with [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) 
- Integrating [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) for data science tasks Visualizing data with [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- Orchestrating workflows with [Dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/)
- Deploying on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) for scalability and cloud-agnostic architecture

### Technologies, Tools, and Frameworks:
This project leverages a vast array of open-source technologies including MinIO, Spark, Delta Lake, Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Druid, Apache Superset, and Dagsterâ€”all running on Kubernetes to ensure scalability and cloud-agnostic deployment.
